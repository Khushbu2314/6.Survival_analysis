# Survival_analysis
Survival analyses in general allow events and non-events to be taken into account.

Here In The Kaplanâ€“Meier estimates are based on the number of patient from the total number of patients who survive for a certain time after treatment,whereas in Cox proportional hazard model consists of hazard function describes the probability of event or hazard h(e.g. survival) up to a particular time t. Hazard function considers covariates to compare the survival of patient groups. 

Interpretation: Here survival analysis of brain cancer is being done where p-value=0.56 ,which indicates the survival probability of males and females is 56%.

The x-axis showed the no. of days in the plot which clearly shows 1000-1100 days for male survival and 1200-1300 days for female,which thus describes the survival probability.
